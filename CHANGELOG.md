# Changelog

## 3.1.1
- Fixed Frame Generation not being detected in games that never call slDLSSGGetState (e.g. Horizon Forbidden West), causing fg_div to stay at 1.0, incorrect FPS display, and wrong pacing intervals
- Fixed G-Sync not being detected in OpenGL games (e.g. OpenMW) because nvapi64.dll isn't auto-loaded by the driver for OpenGL — now force-loads it when needed
- Fixed FPS cap not enforcing during menus, cutscenes, and loading screens in DX12 Reflex games (e.g. Monster Hunter Stories 3, Expedition 33) — falls back to present-based enforcement when NvAPI/PCL markers stop flowing
- Added cadence metering — measures actual presentation cadence from DXGI frame statistics with adaptive bias correction for the scheduler
- Added DX11 flip model override — forces bitblt swapchains to FLIP_DISCARD for true VRR operation and reduced DWM composition latency
- Added system hardening — MMCSS thread registration, DXGI device-level optimizations for frame pacing quality
- Simplified correlator — major rewrite removing ~300 lines, streamlined calibration and stale detection
- Reworked feedback system with cadence meter integration replacing raw correlator-based feedback
- Improved hardware spin loop with better TSC handling
- Reworked stress detector with simplified interface
- Added VSync control improvements for DX11/DX12
- Added vblank thread enhancements
- Various scheduler and predictor optimizations

## 3.1.0
